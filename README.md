# Operating-systems-projects
Collection of projects developed during the Operating Systems course at FAMAF, UNC.

## Labs

### Lab 1 - Mybash
*Description:*  
Development of a *custom Linux shell* to understand the internal workings of a command interpreter, including process execution, input/output redirection, and error handling.

*Technologies and tools:*  
- C
- Linux Shell

*Objectives:*  
- Understand system interaction through system calls.  
- Implement basic shell functionalities (command execution, redirection, pipes).

### Lab 2 - Semaphores in XV6 (RISC-V)
*Description:*  
Implementation and analysis of *semaphores* in the xv6-riscv kernel to control concurrency and process synchronization.

*Technologies and tools:*  
- XV6 (RISC-V)  
- QEMU

*Objectives:*  
- Understand semaphore handling and mutual exclusion in a simple OS.  
- Study synchronization effects on concurrent processes.

------

### Lab 3 - Process Scheduler in XV6 (RISC-V)
*Description:*  
Study and modification of the *process scheduler* in xv6-riscv. The lab includes analyzing the original scheduler, benchmarking CPU-bound and IO-bound processes, and implementing a *3-level MLFQ scheduler*.

*Technologies and tools:*  
- XV6 (RISC-V)  
- QEMU  
- C

*Objectives:*  
- Understand the original scheduling policy and context switching.  
- Measure performance of CPU-bound and IO-bound processes.  
- Implement a MLFQ scheduler with dynamic priority adjustment.  
- Compare performance between the original scheduler and MLFQ
